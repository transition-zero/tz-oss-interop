Feature: osemosys-csv-to-sienna translates one model year into a Sienna operations system
  The operations step reads the canonical stage of an otoole model for one year. Each location
  of an electricity fuel becomes a bus and an area. The demand of an electricity fuel becomes a
  load with an hourly series. The timeslices become representative days of 24 hours, which
  follow each other from 1 January of the year. Each day stands for a number of days of the
  year, and extensions.json records that weight.

  The invented model below has two electricity fuels at the locations AT and DE. Two seasons
  and one day type give two days. Each day has a bracket of 6 h and a bracket of 18 h.
